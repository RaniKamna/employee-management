To set up a ReactJS project, you can follow these general steps:

1. Clone the Repository:
   - Open your terminal or command prompt.
   - Navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository.
   - Run the following command to clone the repository:
     ```
     git clone https://github.com/RaniKamna/employee-management.git
     ```

2. Install Dependencies:
   - Navigate into the cloned repository's directory:
     ```
     cd employee-management
     ```
   - Run the following command to install the project dependencies using a package manager like npm (Node Package Manager):
     ```
     npm install
     ```

3. Start the Development Server:
   - Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the development server to run the React application:
     ```
     npm start
     ```

4. Access the React Application:
   - After running the start command, the React application should be running on a development server, usually on `http://localhost:4000`.
   - Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4000`.
